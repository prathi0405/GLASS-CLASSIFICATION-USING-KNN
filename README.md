# GLASS-CLASSIFICATION-USING-KNN
Glass type classifiaction using using KNN algorithm.

This is a Glass Type Identification Data Set from KAGGLE. It contains 10 attributes including id. The response is glass type(discrete 7 values)

Id number: 1 to 214 (removed from CSV file)

RI: refractive index

Na: Sodium (unit measurement: weight percent in corresponding oxide, as are attributes 4-10)
Mg: Magnesium
Al: Aluminum
Si: Silicon
K: Potassium
Ca: Calcium
Ba: Barium
Fe: Iron
Type of glass
USING KNN algorithm Model is trained and build.
It is an instance-based algorithm.
As opposed to model-based algorithms which pre trains on the data, and discards the data. Instance-based algorithms retain the data to classify when a new data point is given.
STREAMLIT  is used for building an User Interface.
Tech stuffs Used:
    >Python 3.8.8
    >Streamlit
    >Pandas
    >Numpy
    >Scikit learn
